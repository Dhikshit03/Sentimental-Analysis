                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gather comprehensive data that includes various scenarios triggering disgust. This can involve both subjective self-reports and objective measures such as facial expressions or physiological responses.</li>
                        <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Utilize machine learning algorithms to train models on the collected data. Ensure that the models are capable of distinguishing between disgust and similar emotions like anger or fear.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Incorporate features that capture the nuances of disgust, such as changes in facial expressions, voice tone, or physiological indicators like heart rate variability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Regular Validation:</strong> Continuously validate and update the models to improve accuracy. Include diverse datasets to ensure the models can generalize across different individuals and contexts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Intervention Strategies:</strong> Develop strategies to address and manage disgust, such as cognitive-behavioral techniques or exposure therapy, based on the emotional predictions.</li>
